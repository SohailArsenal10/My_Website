## About Me

Hello World, I'm Sohail.I'm currently a Software Engineer and am very passionate about sports since a young age especially analyzing and playing football.
Apart from my sportive nature, I like to meditate which gives me calmness which allows to put things in perspective and also lets me improve as a person and be
the best version of myself as I explore life. I want to explore different places, cultures and cuisines in the future.

Professionally I would like to continually look out for something which people might feel it's good for them and save their time by creating applications which would be open source as well as easy to use which would improve me a lot technically and other aspects like problem solving, use case identification, enhancements and so on. Hopefully my curiosity to learn different things would allow me to deep dive into the trenches of technology.

Lastly I surround myself with good people.Every day I like to wake up and remind myself for the grateful things bestowed upon and around me 
and I want to set myself as a good example to the people in general.
